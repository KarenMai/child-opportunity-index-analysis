# CPA01 - Python Data Analysis II
In our CS103 Software Engineering class, we learned about the importance of data science as it is a growing area in the workforce and field in general. We want to start being able to find and workw ith alrge datasets so that we are more informed and understanding of world around us. This assignment allowed me to explore the pandas pacakge and load in some interesting datasets that I got to analyze. I went with the Heller School's ICYF DataDiveristyKid's COI index and compared it with the Gini Coefficient. I was able to explore some cool relationships and further think about what to explore next!
